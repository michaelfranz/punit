/**
 * Captures use case execution results during experiments.
 *
 * <p>The {@code ResultCaptor} is injected into experiment methods and provides
 * a way to record execution results for aggregation. Each experiment invocation
 * gets a fresh captor instance.
 *
 * <h2>Usage with UseCaseOutcome</h2>
 * <p>The recommended pattern is to record a {@link UseCaseOutcome} which bundles
 * both the result and criteria:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Experiment(useCase = ShoppingUseCase.class, samples = 1000)
 * void measureSearchBaseline(ShoppingUseCase useCase, ResultCaptor captor) {
 *     UseCaseOutcome outcome = useCase.searchProducts("wireless headphones");
 *     captor.record(outcome);  // Records both result and criteria
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Legacy Usage with Separate Result and Criteria</h2>
 * <p>The captor can also record result and criteria separately for backward
 * compatibility:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Experiment(useCase = ShoppingUseCase.class, samples = 1000)
 * void measureSearchBaseline(ShoppingUseCase useCase, ResultCaptor captor) {
 *     UseCaseResult result = useCase.searchProducts("headphones");
 *     captor.record(result);
 *     captor.recordCriteria(useCase.criteria(result));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>How It Works</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The extension creates a new captor for each sample</li>
 *   <li>The captor is injected as a method parameter</li>
 *   <li>The experiment method calls {@code captor.record(outcome)} or {@code captor.record(result)}</li>
 *   <li>After method execution, the extension reads the result and aggregates it</li>
 * </ol>
