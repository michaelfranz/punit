/**
 * A factor source that provides both factors and a stable hash identifier.
 *
 * <p>The hash identifies the factor source, enabling consistency verification
 * between experiments and probabilistic tests. If two runs use the same
 * {@code HashableFactorSource} (same hash), they will consume identical factors
 * when using first-N prefix selection.
 *
 * <h2>Key Properties</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Source-owned hash</b>: The hash is a property of the source itself,
 *       not computed from factors consumed during a run</li>
 *   <li><b>Always available</b>: The hash can be queried at any time,
 *       independent of whether factors have been consumed</li>
 *   <li><b>Sample count irrelevant</b>: Hash comparison works regardless of
 *       how many factors each run consumed</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Implementation Options</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Materialized factors</b>: Compute hash from all factor values (recommended)</li>
 *   <li><b>Configuration identity</b>: Hash based on source configuration</li>
 *   <li><b>Developer-provided</b>: Explicit version identifier</li>
 * </ol>
