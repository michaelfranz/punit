/**
 * Captures use case execution outcomes during experiments.
 *
 * <p>The {@code OutcomeCaptor} is injected into experiment methods and provides
 * a way to record execution outcomes for aggregation. Each experiment invocation
 * gets a fresh captor instance.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Experiment(useCase = ShoppingUseCase.class, samples = 1000)
 * void measureSearchBaseline(ShoppingUseCase useCase, OutcomeCaptor captor) {
 *     UseCaseOutcome<SearchResult> outcome = useCase.searchProducts("wireless headphones");
 *     captor.record(outcome);  // Records result and postconditions
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>How It Works</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The extension creates a new captor for each sample</li>
 *   <li>The captor is injected as a method parameter</li>
 *   <li>The experiment method calls {@code captor.record(outcome)}</li>
 *   <li>After method execution, the extension reads the outcome and aggregates it</li>
 * </ol>
