/**
 * Central formatting utility for pass rates and thresholds.
 *
 * <p>Pass rates are displayed as raw doubles with 4 decimal places (e.g. {@code 0.9999})
 * rather than percentages. This avoids misleading rounding — a threshold of 0.9999 would
 * display as "100.0%" in percentage format, hiding meaningful precision. The number of
 * decimal digits also serves as a visual cue for whether a value was hand-specified
 * (e.g. {@code 0.9500}) or statistically derived (e.g. {@code 0.9160}).
 *
 * <p>Conventional statistical parameters — confidence levels, alpha/false-positive
 * probability, and quantile labels — remain displayed as percentages because users
 * universally expect "95% confidence" not "0.95 confidence".
