/**
 * A diff-optimized projection of a {@link org.javai.punit.contract.UseCaseOutcome}.
 *
 * <p>Designed for line-by-line comparison in diff tools. All projections
 * for the same use case have identical structure regardless of actual
 * content, using placeholders for missing or excess values.
 *
 * <h2>Structure Guarantees</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Results with fewer lines than max: padded with {@link #ABSENT}</li>
 *   <li>Results with exactly max lines: no placeholders</li>
 *   <li>Results with more than max lines: max content lines + truncation notice</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note: The truncation notice does not count toward {@code maxDiffableLines}.
 *
 * <p>Note: Timestamp is intentionally excluded from the projection because it
 * always differs between samples, creating noise in diffs. The timestamp remains
 * available in the underlying outcome for debugging purposes.
