## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Release lifecycle Gradle tasks (`release`, `tagRelease`)
- Centralised version in `gradle.properties`
- `CHANGELOG.md` with validation gate in the release task
- Test intent system: `VERIFICATION` (evidential) and `SMOKE` (sentinel) modes
- Feasibility gate using Wilson score lower bound for verification tests

- Infeasibility fail-fast for infeasible thresholds

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-15

Initial release of PUnit — a JUnit 5 extension framework for probabilistic
unit testing of non-deterministic systems.

### Added
- `@ProbabilisticTest` annotation with configurable samples, minPassRate, and confidence
- `@MeasureExperiment` and `@ExploreExperiment` for baseline measurement and exploration
- `@OptimizeExperiment` for feedback-driven parameter optimization
- Spec-based workflow: measure baseline, generate YAML spec, derive thresholds statistically
- Early termination (impossibility and success-guaranteed detection)
- Time and token cost budgets (method, class, and suite scopes)
- Covariate-aware baseline selection with environmental, temporal, and operational categories
- Design by Contract support via `ServiceContract` and `UseCaseOutcome`
- `@InputSource` for parameterized test inputs (JSON, CSV)
- Instance conformance checking (JSON schema matching)
- Pacing support to avoid rate limits from LLM/API providers
- Statistical engine with Wilson score confidence intervals and threshold derivation
- Verbose statistical explanation output
- Gradle plugin (`org.javai.punit`) for test/experiment task configuration
