## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **PUnit no longer renders HTML; the family's shared `mavai` tool
  does.** The `punitReport`, `explorationReport` and
  `optimizationReport` Gradle tasks are gone, along with the writers
  behind them in `punit-report` (`ReportGenerator`, `HtmlReportWriter`,
  `ReportHtml`, `ComparisonReportHtml`, and the `report.explore` and
  `report.optimize` packages). A framework emits artefacts; turning them
  into a page is one job, done once for punit, feotest and baseltest by
  the [mavai renderer](https://github.com/mavai-org/mavai). Replace
  `./gradlew punitReport` with `mavai verdict build/reports/punit`,
  `explorationReport` with `mavai explore build/punit/explorations/<service>`, and
  `optimizationReport` with `mavai optimize build/punit/optimizations`;
  the User Guide's Part 11 walks through installing the binary and
  rendering each report. `punit-report` remains the home of the verdict
  XML sink, the bundled verdict schemas and the `punitVerify` verifier,
  and no longer depends on snakeyaml. Known gap, recorded rather than
  papered over: `mavai measure` reads `mavai-baseline-1`, while punit
  still writes `punit-baseline-3`, so punit baselines are not yet
  renderable.

### Added

- **A language-model service states how long it will be waited for.**
  The `deadline-ms:` configuration key bounds one exchange — the whole
  exchange, not merely the connection, since the failure it guards
  against is a peer that accepts a request and then goes silent on a
  socket that connected perfectly. Unstated it defaults to 600000 and
  is recorded as such: the deadline is part of the service's identity,
  so it is fingerprinted like any covariate and a baseline measured
  under one deadline does not resolve a test run under another.
  Previously punit set no timeout at either level and such a peer held
  a sample open indefinitely.

- **A failed delivery says what kind of failure it was.** Explore and
  optimize artefacts state `kind` on every failure entry, and a
  delivery entry's condition is its cause — `unreachable`,
  `client-deadline`, `peer-timeout`, `server-error`,
  `unusable-response` — so a configuration whose endpoint was down and
  one whose answers were bad no longer present identically at a pass
  rate of zero. The counting rule is untouched: a failed delivery is a
  failed sample, as before. Authors state a cause from their own
  bindings through `DeliveryCause`.

- **Token usage reaches the artefact cost blocks.** The declarative
  path now listens for token cost: `ConfiguredService` gains an
  additive token-sink invocation default, the language-model type
  reports each exchange's total through it, and the declarative
  contract adapters feed punit's existing token tracking — so the
  explore and optimize artefacts state `totalTokens`/
  `avgTokensPerSample` in their cost blocks whenever a run tracked
  tokens (absent when untracked; token-less artefacts stay
  shape-stable). The shared `mavai` renderer's cost cells show
  "ms · tok" with no renderer change — the interchange fields
  existed all along, waiting to be fed.

- **The programmatic language-model client (`org.mavai.punit.lm.api`).**
  punit-lm opens one exported package: `LanguageModels.configure(Map)`
  takes the services file's `configuration:` block verbatim — the same
  keys, the same validation catalogue and refusal messages, the same
  strict capability gate and provider vetoes, the same
  `mavai.llm.*`/`MAVAI_LLM_*` environment tier — and returns a
  configured `LanguageModel`: one request per invocation, no retries,
  4xx rejection = defect (throws), failed delivery = `Outcome`
  failure. The reply is **usage-bearing**: `LmReply` carries the text
  plus the vendor-reported token usage (input/output/total;
  absent-tolerant), newly extracted from every adapter's wire shape —
  a language model responds with more than a string, and token counts
  feed cost reporting. Providers, wire shapes, and validation stay
  internal; the module's exports pin moves from exports-nothing to
  exports-exactly-`api`.

- **Graduation: the `mavaiMaterialise` task.** For each declared
  contract, emits the equivalent contract as Java source the developer
  owns — the same criteria, thresholds, and declaration order,
  expressed against punit's authoring surface, with a stub invocation
  (graduation transfers invocation ownership) and TODOs where the
  reader's private machinery — selection engines, registered
  predicates, views — becomes the developer's own code. One-shot
  scaffolding under `build/punit/materialised/`: nothing round-trips.
  The emitted source compiles cleanly against punit-core (asserted by
  test). Entry point `ContractMaterialise.run`.

- **The `mavaiCheck` task — zero-sample contract validation.** The
  authoring loop's compile step: `./gradlew mavaiCheck` scans the test
  resource roots for `mavai-contract/1` files and validates every
  load-time join — parse, views, selection expressions, criteria, the
  service definition's strict configuration, the per-input admission
  gate, the exploration grid, the declared optimizations — without
  invoking anything, resolving each contract's conventional
  `MavaiBindings` class when present. One line per validated fact; the
  first failing join fails the task with the same refusal a run would
  give. Includes the **stale-artefact advisory**: exploration artefacts
  no current grid point writes are named (with a multi-vintage note),
  never deleted. The entry point is `ContractCheck.run`, public for
  programmatic use.

- **Named path anchors (declarative contracts and services).** The
  optional top-level `roots:` block declares directory anchors once
  per file — names to relative directories, resolved against the
  declaring file — and every file-referencing position may reach
  through one with `@<name>/…` instead of a `../../..` hop-chain (a
  literal `@`-initial filename is spelled `./@…`; a reference that
  climbs out of its anchor is refused). The `mavai.root.<name>` system
  property, then the `MAVAI_ROOT_<NAME>` environment variable,
  replaces a declared value entirely — the machine-local channel.
  Roots are per-file namespaces. The services format gains its first
  file-referencing position, `system-prompt: {file: <path>}`, resolved
  to the plain string before the type sees the configuration —
  baseline and exploration deltas alike — so identity, provenance,
  and the steppers see the prompt exactly as if written inline.
  Identity is untouched by construction: file inputs fingerprint by
  content, never by path. Per the family amendment (2026-07-29;
  conformance corpus mavai-R v0.10.5 — the gate's known-unmet ledger
  is empty again).

- **The declarative-format conformance gate.** punit-decl's test suite
  now drives the format layer — contract parsing plus the load-time
  construction walk, and full services-file resolution — over every
  case of the family's published conformance corpus, fetched from the
  latest mavai-R release on each build (`fetchPublishedFormats`; local
  override `-PformatsDir`). The corpus manifest's binding obligations
  (outcome, and refusal *category*; wording stays punit's own) are
  asserted case by case, the run diffs its assertions against the full
  obligation so selective assertion fails the build, and obligations
  punit does not yet meet sit on a known-unmet ledger asserted
  inverted — an entry names the directive that retires it, and the
  ledger only shrinks truthfully.

- **Normative judgement at experiment time.** A measure experiment over
  a contract that declares normative criteria (`meeting().passRate(...)`)
  now judges each one against its stipulated threshold using the run's
  own samples — the Wilson one-sided lower confidence bound at the run's
  sample count, at the criterion's confidence. The judgement (met /
  failed / unsupportable-with-feasible-minimum) is rendered in the
  experiment's console output and recorded per criterion in the baseline
  file as an additive `normativeJudgement` marker that resolvers and
  threshold derivation ignore; existing baseline files parse unchanged.
  Empirical criteria remain unjudged at experiment time. `run()`'s
  completion semantics are unchanged — it never fails on a failed
  judgement; the new `assertMeets()` terminal (mutually exclusive with
  `run()`) performs the same run and persistence, then throws
  `AssertionFailedError` on a failed judgement and
  `UnsupportableJudgementException` (a `TestAbortedException` subtype,
  identifying the cause for listeners and report tooling) on an
  unsupportable one, with the baseline artefact on disk before any
  throw.
- **`PUNIT_BASELINE_DIR` environment variable** for baseline-directory
  resolution (`BaselineResolver.defaultDir()`), checked between the
  existing `punit.baseline.dir` system property and the fixed convention
  path. Closes a gap relative to punit's own documented configuration
  resolution order (system property → environment variable → default);
  particularly useful for sentinel deployments in containerized
  environments, where setting an environment variable is typically more
  natural than controlling the JVM launch command line.

### Changed

- **A trial that fails before evaluation counts against every
  criterion.** A failed delivery — or any other apply-level
  `Outcome.fail` — judged nothing, and previously reached no
  criterion's tally at all, so per-criterion pass rates were computed
  over a denominator that silently excluded them and a run where
  nothing was delivered emitted an empty `criteria` block that failed
  schema validation outright. Such a trial is now a failure against
  every declared criterion, on a `applyFail` axis of its own rather
  than folded into condition or transform failures that did not
  happen. Per-criterion rates and verdicts now agree with the
  aggregate, which already counted these failures. Aligns punit with
  the family's Python reader.

- **Exploration output is laid out by swept keys.** Each EXPLORE run
  writes its per-configuration artefacts into an experiment-level
  sub-directory named by the factors the experiment sweeps —
  `explorations/<contract>/temperature/`,
  `…/temperature+model/`, or `…/baseline-only/` when nothing varies —
  so evolving what is swept opens a fresh directory: a superseded
  artefact can never sit beside fresh ones, and a no-sweep run and a
  sweep never share a directory. Artefact contents and filenames
  within a directory are unchanged. Adopts the family layout
  (2026-07-29); existing flat directories are operator-owned working
  output and are not migrated. (The in-punit exploration comparison
  report was left untouched: punit's report module is slated to be
  dropped in favour of the shared `mavai` renderer.)

- **Artefact key discipline and the redesigned `failureDistribution`
  (breaking for exploration and optimization outputs).** The
  `statistics.failureDistribution` block of `mavai-explore-1` and
  `mavai-optimize-1` documents is now a *sequence* of
  `{condition, count}` entries instead of a mapping keyed by
  free-text check identity: each failed trial is attributed to its
  first failing condition, so entry counts sum to the enclosing
  `failures` total, and no mapping key carries unbounded free text.
  Every mapping key punit emits into these artefacts (postcondition
  descriptions in `resultProjection`, criterion names, factor names)
  is now bounded at 256 characters — comfortably under YAML's
  1,024-character implicit-key limit — with over-long keys truncated
  to a bounded prefix plus a short content hash so distinct keys
  stay distinct. Per-input identity remains structural
  (`inputIndex`); input text appears only in values. The vendored
  interchange schemas are re-pinned to the mavai-R v0.9.0
  publication, and the conformance suite now drives a run with a
  >1,024-character input and over-long condition identities to prove
  the emitted document parses and validates.

- **Canonical interchange schemas for experiment artefacts (breaking
  for exploration and optimization outputs).** EXPLORE and OPTIMIZE
  runs now emit the mavai family's canonical interchange formats —
  `mavai-explore-1` (one YAML per explored configuration) and
  `mavai-optimize-1` (one YAML per optimize run) — in place of the
  punit-private `punit-spec-1` shape those two artefacts carried
  before. The service identity field is now `serviceContractId`
  (was `useCaseId`), exploration documents carry the configuration's
  display name in a new body field `configuration` (the same
  human-readable stem used for the filename, so consumers never
  parse filenames), and the per-criterion `statistics.criteria`
  decomposition is always present. The HTML comparison report
  readers follow the new field names and schema identities, so
  reports over newly emitted artefacts work unchanged; documents in
  the old shape are no longer read. Baseline specs (MEASURE) and
  verdict XML are untouched — `punit-spec-1` baselines and the spec
  registry are unaffected. Emitted artefacts are validated in the
  test suite against the pinned published JSON Schemas
  (mavai-R release v0.8.6), including the semantic obligations the
  schemas cannot express (ascending passing-latency vector,
  floor-gated percentile statement, convergence consistency).

- **Per-criterion matrix transposed in both comparison HTML reports.**
  The exploration and optimization comparison reports' "Per-criterion
  comparison" table now lists variants/iterations as rows and criteria
  as columns (previously the reverse). Bounds the table's column count
  to the criteria set instead of letting it grow with every
  variant/iteration, and aligns row identity with the leaderboard
  table above it.
- **Comparison-report renderers de-duplicated.** The Explore and
  Optimize `HtmlWriter`s shared a near-identical `CriterionResult`
  record and near-identical per-criterion-matrix, latency-cell,
  cost-cell, termination-cell, pass-rate-cell, number-formatting, and
  chart-CSS code. `CriterionResult` and these section renderers now
  live once in a new `org.mavai.punit.report.ComparisonReportHtml`
  (alongside the existing shared `ReportHtml`); each report's
  `HtmlWriter` supplies only what's genuinely report-specific. No
  behavioural change — output is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **A declarative service type is found from a consuming project.**
  The `language-model` type is discovered through `ServiceLoader`,
  which was asked for the *context* classloader's view — correct
  inside punit's own build, and empty in a consuming project whose
  test runtime loads punit-decl and punit-lm differently. A first
  declarative test could resolve `type: language-model` in punit and
  not in the project that depends on it. Discovery now uses the
  defining classloader.

- **A declarative project needs no bindings class.** A contract whose
  every service is declared in `mavai-services.yaml` has nothing to
  bind, but the loader still required a `MavaiBindings` class to
  exist and refused when it did not. The bindings artefact is now
  optional, which is what makes the two-YAML-files-and-a-one-line-body
  path in the user guide actually reachable.

- **The Wilson lower bound is exactly zero at a zero rate.** At
  `p̂ = 0` the bound's centre and margin are the same quantity and
  cancel; binary floating point does not reliably deliver that, and
  the residue — invisible against any tolerance — turned a derived
  cutoff of 0 into 1 through `ceil`, demanding one success of a test
  whose baseline could demand none. Now returned exactly, with a
  property test sweeping every sample size at three confidences.

- **Measure output names its persisted artefact.** A recording's
  product is the baseline, not a verdict — every MEASURE run now
  prints `baseline recorded: <path>` as the artefact lands, closing an
  honest-output gap (the shape rule: a recording is labelled, renders
  no composite verdict, and names what it persisted — the first two
  already held, pinned by a new regression test alongside the fix).

- **An `initial:` overlay restating the baseline is now refused.** The
  conformance gate's first catch: an optimization's `initial:` that
  resolves to the baseline configuration's own covariate point changes
  nothing (iteration 0 starts from the baseline by default) and is now
  a load refusal, per the services format.

- **The graded set claim (declarative contracts).** A new composite
  postcondition form, `set-of:`, states a graded membership claim over
  a path's selection as one check: `required:` members must all
  appear, `optional:` members may, `min-present:` sets a floor over
  the distinct optional members (a count, or `"N%"` resolved by
  floor), and `refuse-extras:` (default true) forbids unlisted
  members. Membership semantics throughout — a set is a set:
  duplicates collapse on both sides, an operand duplicate draws a
  load-time console warning (never a refusal), and a duplicated
  subject element is one member present, never an extra. Degenerate
  spellings a sharper form owns are refused naming that form
  (`equals-set:`, `contains-set:`), and the failure reason states the
  arithmetic — missing required members, present-versus-floor count,
  extras — each list bounded. Per the family's graded-set-claims
  amendment (2026-07-29; conformance corpus mavai-R ≥ v0.10.4).

- **Partial credit for optional postconditions.** A criterion check may
  be declared `optional` (programmatic `.optional()`, declarative
  `optional: true`), and the criterion may grant an `optional-slack`
  budget — an absolute count or an `"N%"` floor over the applicable
  optional checks. A trial still resolves to a single Bernoulli
  outcome: it fails when any required check fails, or when the number
  of failed optional checks exceeds the slack budget. Both marks are a
  double opt-in — an `optional` check without a slack budget binds
  exactly as before, and a slack budget with no optional checks is
  inert. Recorded per-check outcomes stay true; only the acceptance
  predicate changes. Per the family partial-credit ruling (2026-07).

- **Postcondition standings.** Every run now states a descriptive
  per-`(input, check)` tally — passed, failed, skipped, and the
  observed fraction — beside the verdict, with the declared
  optional-slack budget verbatim. Descriptive vocabulary only: no
  intervals, no thresholds, no per-check verdicts; the criterion stays
  the only judged unit. The standings surface everywhere a run
  reports: the console verdict, the verdict XML record (schema version
  1.4, first-class `<postcondition-standings>` element), the MEASURE
  baseline YAML, and the per-criterion statistics of the explore and
  optimize artefacts.

- **The default subject view (declarative contracts).** A `path:`-bearing
  check may now omit `in:`: its subject resolves to the view named by the
  owning criterion's single `parses:` form, else the contract's sole
  declared transform, else a load refusal naming the check and both fixes
  — retiring the near-universal `in: <view>` boilerplate line. A path-less
  bare check still judges the raw response, an explicit `in:` always wins,
  and a `path:` can never target `raw`. Resolution happens at parse time,
  so the compiled criterion is indistinguishable from one with `in:`
  spelled. Per the family's 2026-07-27 subject-rule amendment
  (conformance corpus mavai-R ≥ v0.10.0).

- **Named scorers, stated in the optimize artefact.** `Scorer` gains an
  optional identity (`Scorer.name()`, default empty) and a built-in
  named implementation, `Scorer.observedPassRate()`, which scores each
  iteration by the observed pass rate the artefact's statistics block
  states. When an optimize experiment's scorer carries a name, the
  emitted `mavai-optimize-1` document states it in the additive
  `scorer` field (e.g. `scorer: observed-pass-rate`), so downstream
  consumers — the shared `mavai optimize` report — can label what the
  score measures. Ad-hoc lambda scorers remain unnamed and the field
  stays absent: the artefact never claims an identity the author did
  not declare.

### Documentation

- **Corrected baseline-directory guidance in `SENTINEL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`
  and `USER-GUIDE.md`.** The deployment guide previously told readers to
  configure the baseline output directory via `-Dpunit.spec.dir` /
  `PUNIT_SPEC_DIR` — those properties are real, but govern a different,
  unrelated subsystem (the `ExecutionSpecification`/spec-resolver
  machinery), not baseline resolution; following the guide's own worked
  example would not have produced the intended effect. The same section
  also claimed baseline resolution was "layered" (environment-local first,
  classpath fallback) — that description applies to specs, not baselines.
  Both are corrected to name `punit.baseline.dir` / `PUNIT_BASELINE_DIR`
  and to describe the actual single-tier resolution. `USER-GUIDE.md` Part
  10 (Sentinels) previously said nothing about baseline file location for
  deployed sentinels at all; it now has a dedicated subsection covering
  both the write side (a sentinel running a MEASURE `@Experiment`) and the
  read side (a sentinel running a `@ProbabilisticTest`). Appendix A's
  configuration table and Part 4's baseline-location paragraph both
  previously described the convention-default path as "on the classpath"
  — it's a filesystem path relative to the working directory, not a
  classpath resource lookup; corrected in both places.

- Brought the optimize comparison report's description in the user guide
  (Part 11) in line with the 0.9.3 run-order layout — iterations listed in
  run order with a **Rank** column, not a score-sorted leaderboard.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Optimization comparison report lists iterations in run order.** The
  iteration table — previously an "Iteration leaderboard" sorted by score —
  now lists iterations chronologically by iteration index, carrying the
  score rank in a **Rank** column rather than by row order, so the run
  reads as the sequence it actually ran in. The chosen-best iteration is
  highlighted (row tint, green accent, and badge) instead of relying on row
  position, and a low-but-valid score is no longer visually conflated with
  an error — only abnormal termination is flagged. The per-criterion
  comparison columns follow the same run order. Near-equal scores still
  share a rank (read as a repeated rank value in the table); the `≈`
  too-close-to-call marker now appears only in the overview's leading
  cluster, not on the table rows.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-30

> **Highlights:** two new **experiment comparison reports** — a
> browser-friendly, self-contained HTML page that ranks the candidates of
> an EXPLORE or OPTIMIZE experiment so you can see which performed best
> without reading the raw YAML.

### Added

- **Exploration comparison report (`explorationReport` task).** Renders a
  single self-contained HTML page comparing the variants of an EXPLORE
  experiment — overall and per criterion. Per service: a ranked
  leaderboard (overall pass rate, then latency, then cost), a per-criterion
  matrix comparing the variants check-by-check, and a latency-distribution
  strip per variant. Variants whose ordering rests on a margin within 5%
  are flagged *too close to call* — a presentational marker, not a
  significance test. Reads the exploration YAML under
  `build/punit/explorations/<service>/` (the `explorationsDir`) and writes
  `build/reports/punit-explorations/html/index.html`.

- **Optimization comparison report (`optimizationReport` task).** Renders a
  single self-contained HTML page summarising an OPTIMIZE experiment's
  iterations, ranked by the scorer (objective-aware: `MAXIMIZE` /
  `MINIMIZE`). Per run: names the service and objective, a score-ranked
  iteration leaderboard with each row expanding to reveal the factor bundle
  that produced it, a per-criterion matrix, and a score trajectory across
  the run, with the chosen best iteration highlighted. Iterations within 5%
  of each other on score are flagged *too close to call*. Reads the
  optimization YAML under `build/punit/optimizations/<service>/` (the
  `optimizationsDir`) and writes
  `build/reports/punit-optimizations/html/index.html`.

  Both reports share the test report's styling and, like it, embed all CSS
  and make no external requests — they open directly from disk with no
  server. Run them after the experiment that produces the data
  (`./gradlew exp -Prun=…`); with no experiments present, the report states
  that none were found rather than failing the build.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Verdict-XML namespace `http://javai.org/verdict/1.0` →
  `http://mavai.org/verdict/1.0` (breaking interchange change).** The
  verdict-XML wire namespace moves off `javai.org` to complete the family
  rename. The writer emits, and the reader accepts, only the `mavai.org`
  namespace — documents in the old namespace are no longer read. Only the
  namespace host changes; the schema shape and all schema versions
  (1.0 / 1.1 / 1.2) are unchanged. Consumers parsing the verdict XML by
  namespace must update. (Released as a patch version by project decision
  despite the breaking nature.)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **Coordinate / package / module / plugin-id move to `org.mavai`
  (breaking).** punit has moved off the `org.javai` namespace:
  - Maven coordinates: `org.javai:punit{,-core,-report,-sentinel}` →
    `org.mavai:punit{,-core,-report,-sentinel}`.
  - Java packages: `org.javai.punit.*` → `org.mavai.punit.*`.
  - JPMS modules: `org.javai.punit.{core,report,sentinel}` →
    `org.mavai.punit.{core,report,sentinel}`. Modular consumers update
    their `requires` directives accordingly.
  - Gradle plugin id: `org.javai.punit` → `org.mavai.punit`
    (`plugins { id("org.mavai.punit") }`).
  - The `outcome` dependency follows its own move to
    `org.mavai:outcome`.

  No API surface change — every type, annotation, and method keeps its
  simple name; only the namespace differs. Final `org.javai:punit*`
  releases carry a Maven relocation POM that auto-redirects with a
  deprecation warning; the Gradle Plugin Portal cannot redirect, so a
  final `org.javai.punit` plugin release points at the new id. The
  verdict-XML wire namespace (`http://javai.org/verdict/1.0`) is
  unchanged — it is a cross-framework interchange identifier, not a
  Maven coordinate.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-21

> **Highlights:** **baseline expiration** — measured baselines can now
> carry a validity window that surfaces as a verdict caveat, with a
> configurable fail-on-expired policy — and the probabilistic-test
> **inline contract** (`Contract.inline()`), which authors a
> single-artefact contractual test with no separate `ServiceContract`
> class. Also adds expected-value matching and renames "zero tolerance"
> to "zero failures".

### Added

- **Inline contract authoring surface (`Contract.inline()`).** Declares
  a contractual probabilistic test in one method — the service call
  (`invoking` / `returning`), a single criterion (`passRate` /
  `zeroFailures`, refined with `satisfies` / `where` / `contractRef` /
  `latencyAtMost`), and a contract-first `sampling(n, inputs)` terminal —
  with no named `ServiceContract` class. Restricted by design to
  contractual criteria (no empirical path — the absence is enforced at
  compile time) and to a single criterion. Empirical baselines,
  covariates, configurable factors, reuse, and multiple
  independently-thresholded criteria remain the province of a named
  `ServiceContract`, which the inline body lifts into verbatim; `build()`
  yields a `ServiceContract` for the factored explore / optimize path.
  The user-guide quick start now opens with this form.
- **Baseline expiration.** A measured baseline can declare a validity
  window via `MeasureBuilder.expiresInDays(n)`, persisted into the
  `punit-baseline-3` schema. An expired (or soon-to-expire) baseline
  surfaces as a verdict caveat on the typed path
  (`WarningLevel.APPROACHING` / `EXPIRED`), and a configurable policy can
  escalate an expired baseline to a failing verdict.
- **Expected-value matching.** Inputs implementing `Expected<O>` can be
  matched against produced outputs via `ValueMatcher` and the
  `.matchedBy(...)` / `.matchedByEquality()` criterion shape.

### Changed

- **Terminology: "zero tolerance" → "zero failures".** The
  any-failure-fails criterion and its surrounding prose and identifiers
  now use "zero failures" consistently (`zeroFailures()`).
- Removed redundant attribution-licensing references left over from the
  Apache 2.0 relicense.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-20

> **🎯 Stable release.** Graduates the 0.7.0-alpha series straight
> to 0.8.0. Highlights since 0.7.0-alpha6: Apache 2.0 relicense
> with DCO contributor model; MEASURE baseline schema bump
> `punit-baseline-2` → `punit-baseline-3` (per-methodology-
> criterion shape); HTML report per-criterion breakdown;
> back-compat constructor cleanup on `ProbabilisticTestResult`
> and `SampleSummary`; verdict-XML 1.1 schema; retirement of
> the legacy `PostconditionBuilder` authoring path in favour of
> the value-form `Criteria.meeting()` / `Criteria.empirical()`
> factory shape. See section headings below for details.

### Changed (license)

- **Relicensed from Attribution Required License (ARL-1.0) to
  Apache License, Version 2.0.** All source, build metadata
  (`punit-core`, `punit-sentinel`, `punit-report`, umbrella POM),
  and documentation now reference Apache 2.0. The `LICENSE` and
  `NOTICE` files at the repository root carry the canonical text.
  Versions of PUnit published prior to this change remain
  available under their original ARL-1.0 terms; the relicense
  applies from this release forward.
- **Contributions now governed by the Developer Certificate of
  Origin (DCO).** The DCO 1.1 text is committed verbatim as
  `dco.txt`; `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the `git commit -s`
  sign-off requirement. A GitHub Actions workflow
  (`.github/workflows/dco.yml`) blocks unsigned commits on pull
  requests. No separate contributor agreement is required —
  Apache 2.0 §5 (inbound = outbound) combined with the per-commit
  DCO sign-off carries the legal weight.

### Changed (MEASURE baseline schema — per-methodology-criterion shape)

- **Baseline YAML schema bumps from `punit-baseline-2` to
  `punit-baseline-3`.** The `statistics.bernoulli-pass-rate`
  block now nests a `criteria:` sub-map keyed by methodology
  criterion id; each entry carries its own `observedPassRate`
  and `sampleCount`. K=1 contracts (the common case, via the
  legacy `postconditions(ContractBuilder)` path) produce a
  single-entry map keyed by the auto-derived
  `DefaultCriterion.id()`. K&gt;1 contracts (those declaring
  `criteria(CriteriaBuilder)` explicitly) produce one entry
  per methodology criterion in contract declaration order. The
  top-level `latency:` block is unchanged — latency stays at the
  run level, not partitioned by criterion.

- **`BaselineReader` rejects `punit-baseline-2` files with a
  re-MEASURE migration message.** No silent read-time adapter=.
  Files on disk in the older shape must be regenerated i.e. .
  experiments must be re-run.

- **`PerCriterionPassRateStatistics` is a new `BaselineStatistics`
  variant** wrapping `Map<String, PassRateStatistics>`. It is
  what the baseline file's `bernoulli-pass-rate` block
  deserialises to. The `BaselineResolver` unwraps it for callers
  that request `PassRateStatistics.class` (the empirical
  `PassRate` evaluator): single-entry maps yield their lone
  entry; multi-entry maps fast-fail with an
  `IllegalStateException` naming the criteria — multi-criterion
  empirical evaluation awaits the evaluator-inference machinery
  (deferred to a later directive).

- **`BaselineEmitter` composes the per-criterion structure from
  the engine's `SampleSummary.criterionSampleCounts()`**, one
  entry per methodology criterion the engine recorded. No new
  arithmetic — the per-criterion pass / total counts come
  straight from the engine's already-recorded data.

### Added (HTML report — per-criterion breakdown)

- **HTML report renders the methodology-level per-criterion
  decomposition** at the deepest expansion level of each test row.
  When the verdict carries a `<per-criterion>` structure (verdict
  XML 1.2, or in-memory results that produced one), the new
  `Per-criterion breakdown` `<details>` block lists one block per
  criterion, headed by the criterion's identifier. Each block
  shows the three-valued verdict (PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE) with
  the existing verdict-CSS colouring, the per-outcome sample
  counts (pass / fail / inconclusive / total), the observed
  marginal pass-rate, and the threshold the row was judged
  against. `NaN` observed-rates and thresholds render as a dash.
  The block is omitted entirely for runs that produced no
  per-criterion structure (legacy 1.0 XML, apply-level-failure
  runs).
- **Composite verdict is not duplicated as a separate line.** The
  level-1 verdict column already carries the composite under the
  step-4 cutover (the composite *is* the test's verdict); the new
  block surfaces the rows the composite was composed from.
- **Latency is not added as a per-criterion row.** It remains
  surfaced once, in the dedicated p50 / p95 / p99 columns at
  level 1 and the Statistical Analysis block at level 3.

### Removed (`ProbabilisticTestResult` back-compat constructors)

- **`ProbabilisticTestResult` 5-arg, 6-arg, 7-arg, 8-arg, and 9-arg
  back-compat constructors** withdrawn. Introduced over the rollouts
  that added `CovariateAlignment`, `contractRef`,
  `failuresByPostcondition`, `EngineRunSummary`, and
  `PerCriterionEvaluation` respectively, they have served their
  migration purpose; every caller now passes the canonical 10-arg
  form. The `withCovariates(...)` and `withContractRef(...)`
  copy-on-write methods are unchanged.

### Removed (`SampleSummary` back-compat constructors)

- **`SampleSummary` 9-arg, 10-arg, and 11-arg back-compat
  constructors** withdrawn. Introduced over the step-3 / step-4 /
  step-5 rollout, they have served their migration purpose; every
  caller now passes the full canonical 12-arg form (outcomes,
  elapsed, successes, failures, tokensConsumed, failuresDropped,
  latencyResult, terminationReason, trials, failuresByPostcondition,
  passingLatencyResult, criterionSampleCounts). A follow-on directive
  will revisit the shape of `SampleSummary` itself — the canonical
  arity is the right thing to sweep first, then the shape.

### Removed (legacy-aggregate deprecation close-out)

- **`ProbabilisticTestResult.legacyAggregateVerdict`** —
  the transitional `Optional<Verdict>` field introduced at the
  step-4 cutover for one release as an audit-trail aid for K>1
  contracts whose JUnit outcome changed. The one-release window has
  closed; the field is gone. `ProbabilisticTest.conclude(...)` no
  longer computes the pre-cutover legacy aggregate.

- **`ProbabilisticTestVerdict.legacyAggregateVerdict`** and the
  matching builder setter — same field at the persistence layer, also
  gone.

- **`<legacy-aggregate>` XML element** — the transitional one-release
  child of `<per-criterion>` is withdrawn. The schema bumps from
  `verdict-1.1.xsd` to `verdict-1.2.xsd`; the new schema's
  `PerCriterionType` carries `<criterion>*` and `<composite>` only.
  Both `verdict-1.0.xsd` and `verdict-1.1.xsd` are retained for one
  release each as references. The `VerdictXmlReader` remains
  permissive — a stray `<legacy-aggregate>` element from a 1.1
  emitter still in service is silently ignored at parse, not
  rejected.

- **Transparent-stats audit-trail callout** — the per-criterion block
  no longer emits the "pre-cutover aggregate verdict was X; the
  composite is now authoritative" callout. The block renders the
  per-criterion table and the composite line only.

### Added (verdict-XML 1.1 schema)

- **`verdict-1.1.xsd`** — additive schema bump under the existing
  `http://javai.org/verdict/1.0` namespace. Adds an optional
  `<per-criterion>` bundle under `<verdict-record>` carrying the
  methodology-level decomposition:

  - `<criterion id="…" verdict="PASS|FAIL|INCONCLUSIVE"
       pass="…" fail="…" inconclusive="…" total="…"
       observed-rate="…" threshold="…"/>` — one element per
    criterion the contract declared, in declaration order.
    `observed-rate` and `threshold` are optional attributes omitted
    when the in-memory value is `NaN`.
  - `<composite value="…"/>` — the composite verdict over the rows
    under the FAIL-dominant rule (§1.4.6).
  - `<legacy-aggregate value="…"/>` — transitional one-release
    audit-trail element mirroring `ProbabilisticTestResult.legacyAggregateVerdict()`.
    Present only when the in-memory `Optional` is populated. A
    follow-on directive removes both this element and the in-memory
    field.

  Emitter sets the root `<verdict-record version>` attribute to
  `"1.1"` when 1.1 content is populated, `"1.0"` otherwise.
  `verdict-1.0.xsd` is retained for one release as a reference;
  consumers strictly validating against 1.0 will reject 1.1
  `<per-criterion>` content (the additive-evolution break).

- **`ProbabilisticTestVerdict`** gains
  `Optional<PerCriterionStructure> perCriterion` and
  `Optional<Verdict> legacyAggregateVerdict` components; two
  back-compat constructors (17-arg, 16-arg) layered to preserve
  existing call sites.

- **`VerdictXmlReader`** parses both 1.0 and 1.1 messages
  permissively — the new elements are read when present and absent
  Optionals are preserved otherwise.

### Cross-framework coordination

- Feotest's verdict reader and emitter follow in their own
  directive. The shared schema artefact is the coordination point;
  feotest's update lands when feotest's step-4-equivalent is on
  the runway.

### Changed (behavioural)

- **Composite verdict is now the contract's overall verdict authority.**
  Step 4 of the multi-criterion rollout. `ProbabilisticTestResult.verdict()`
  is now driven by the methodology-level per-criterion composite under
  the FAIL-dominant rule (companion §1.4.6) rather than the legacy
  spec-layer flat-aggregation over the functional verdict-component
  alone. Cross-dimension aggregation (functional + latency) continues
  to flow through `Verdict.compose` — the per-criterion composite
  substitutes the functional verdict-component's verdict, then
  compose handles cross-dimension under the existing INCONCLUSIVE-first
  rule.

  **K=1 contracts:** byte-identical. The per-criterion composite
  over one verdict equals that verdict, so the substitution is a
  no-op.

  **K>1 contracts:** the *hiding result* case — one criterion
  genuinely failing, others passing, flat-aggregation passing — now
  reports FAIL at the harness boundary. Authors of K>1 contracts
  whose JUnit outcome changed should review.

  **Empty per-criterion evaluation** (apply-level-failure runs where
  `Contract.evaluateClauses` never fired): falls back to the legacy
  flat-aggregation result.

### Added

- **`ProbabilisticTestResult.legacyAggregateVerdict`** —
  `Optional<Verdict>` component carrying the pre-cutover
  `Verdict.compose(evaluated)` value. Transitional artefact carried
  for one release so authors of affected K>1 contracts can see what
  the verdict was pre-step-4. A follow-on directive removes it.

- **Transparent-stats audit-trail callout.** When the pre-cutover
  legacy aggregate differs from the composite, the per-criterion
  block in the transparent-stats output emits a line noting the
  pre-cutover verdict and the new authoritative composite. Replaces
  step 3's evidence-gathering callout.

### Deferred to follow-on directive

- **Verdict-XML schema bump to `verdict-1.1.xsd`** — explicit
  per-criterion table and composite element. The existing
  `<verdict>` element correctly carries the composite as the
  authoritative value because `ProbabilisticTestResult.verdict()`
  returns the composite. The XSD bump adds explanatory surfaces
  (per-criterion breakdown, explicit composite element) and is the
  subject of a separate directive after we gather experience from
  this cutover. Cross-framework coordination (feotest reader) lands
  with that directive.

- **Conformance-fixture consumption** from javai-R v0.8.0 remains
  pending per a separate directive.

## [0.7.0-alpha6] - 2026-05-12

> **🧪 Experimental release.** Breaking: renames the authoring-surface
> interface `UseCase` → `ServiceContract` and its companion types.
> See *Changed (breaking)* below for the migration recipe. Wire
> format unchanged.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`UseCase` → `ServiceContract`.** The authoring-surface
  interface renames from `org.javai.punit.api.UseCase<F, I, O>`
  to `org.javai.punit.api.ServiceContract<F, I, O>`. The
  abstract/concrete split with `Contract<I, O>` is preserved:
  `ServiceContract` extends `Contract` exactly as `UseCase` did.
  Companion types follow:
  - `UseCaseOutcome<O>` → `ServiceContractOutcome<O>`
  - `UseCaseAttributes` → `ServiceContractAttributes`

  Builder / factory identifier renames pair with the type
  rename: `useCaseFactory(...)` → `serviceContractFactory(...)`,
  `resolveUseCaseId` → `resolveServiceContractId`, parameter and
  field names `useCase` → `serviceContract` across the API.

  **Migration recipe** (find-and-replace, IDE refactor
  recommended):
  - `UseCase`, `UseCaseOutcome`, `UseCaseAttributes` →
    `ServiceContract`, `ServiceContractOutcome`,
    `ServiceContractAttributes`
  - `useCase`, `useCaseFactory`, `useCaseAttributes` →
    `serviceContract`, `serviceContractFactory`,
    `serviceContractAttributes`

  **Wire format unchanged.** The RP07 verdict XML attribute
  remains `use-case-id`; the YAML baseline / spec field remains
  `useCaseId`. Existing baselines load against the new release
  without regeneration; existing verdict XML validates against
  the unchanged RP07 schema. The Java↔wire asymmetry is
  deliberate — wire-format regeneration is reserved for a
  later, separate release.

  Rationale: "use case" was overloaded across the field (UML /
  Jacobson sense, regulatory deployment-scenario sense, generic
  product-discussion sense) and told a punit author nothing
  about the artefact's purpose in probabilistic-testing context.
  "Service contract" names the thing it is: the specification
  of correct behaviour the framework measures against.

### Documentation

- **`-alpha` exit criterion closed.** Both gaps the original
  0.7.0-alpha CHANGELOG declared as the qualifier's exit criteria
  are now in:
  - *Statistical early termination* (PT09 / PT10) landed via #150
    in 0.7.0-alpha5's window. Failure-inevitable and
    success-guaranteed short-circuits fire from
    `Engine.Aggregator`; `disableEarlyTermination()` on
    `ProbabilisticTest.Builder` covers the opt-out cases.
  - *Wider feasibility-gate audit* — the headline concern,
    "configurations whose implied confidence falls below 80% are
    not yet rejected across all intents," was already closed in
    `Feasibility.check` (the soundness-floor branch aborts before
    the intent-specific path, so VERIFICATION and SMOKE trip the
    same abort). `SoundnessFloorTest` is the end-to-end audit. The
    alpha4 / alpha5 release notes carried the gap text by inertia;
    code-side it had been resolved in the alpha2 feasibility-gate
    arc.
- **Test-class doc:** `PreflightInvariantsTest` class-level
  javadoc previously called the soundness floor "intentionally
  absent — recorded as a gap." That note no longer matched the
  code path; rewritten to point at `SoundnessFloorTest` as the
  dedicated audit and `Feasibility.check`'s cross-intent abort as
  the enforcement seam.

The implication: the original `-alpha` exit criteria are in. The
qualifier itself is **held**, not dropped — the breaking-change
train is not yet complete. The `UseCase` → `ServiceContract`
rename (see the *Changed (breaking)* entry above) lands in this
release; further breaking-shaped work (optimize-experiment API
DX, verdict-catalogue rebuild) still needs to be triaged as
additive or breaking. The qualifier drops when the
breaking-change train is genuinely complete, not on the
mechanical closure of the original criteria — trust in a
stability signal is built slowly and lost in one move; spending
the qualifier to absorb anticipated breaks is the cheaper path.

## [0.7.0-alpha5] - 2026-05-11

> **🧪 Experimental release.** Adopts `org.javai:outcome` 0.3.0,
> which now ships a real `module-info.class`. The build-time
> `extra-java-module-info` shim that 0.7.0-alpha4 used to wrap
> outcome as an automatic module is gone, and so is the
> `org.gradlex.extra-java-module-info` Gradle plugin from
> `punit-core`. Modular consumers of the published artifact pick up
> outcome 0.3.0 transitively and `requires org.javai.outcome`
> resolves to a real named module — no consumer-side shim needed.
>
> No source changes. No API changes.

### Changed
- **`org.javai:outcome` dependency bumped from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0**
  in both `build.gradle.kts` (root) and `punit-core/build.gradle.kts`.
  The bump is the headline reason for this release; classpath
  consumers see nothing new, but the modular-consumer story is now
  honest end-to-end.

### Removed
- **`extra-java-module-info` shim and plugin.** `punit-core` no
  longer applies `org.gradlex.extra-java-module-info` and no longer
  carries the `extraJavaModuleInfo { automaticModule(...) }` block.
  With outcome 0.3.0 providing its own descriptor, the shim's exit
  condition (noted as a `TODO` since alpha4) is met.

## [0.7.0-alpha4] - 2026-05-11

> **🧪 Experimental release.** The 0.7.x public-surface
> consolidation arc: JPMS `module-info.java` on every published
> library module, the `punit-junit5` bundler artifact retired, four
> verdict-side types promoted out of `internal.*` to their natural

>
> **Exit criterion for `-alpha`.** The two gaps documented in
> 0.7.0-alpha — statistical early termination (PT09/PT10) and the
> wider feasibility-gate audit (sub-80% implied confidence
> rejection across all intents) — remain the contract for shipping
> 0.7.0 without a qualifier. `-alpha` stays on until both close.

### Added (JPMS module declarations)

Three of punit's four library modules now ship a
`module-info.java` declaring exports, requires, and ServiceLoader
provides/uses. `module-info.class` is the published artifact-level
expression of the public-surface promise the
`org.javai.punit.internal.*` namespace started.

- **`punit-core`** declares module `org.javai.punit.core`. Exports
  every public package (`api`, `api.spec`, `api.covariate`,
  `api.match`, `runtime`, `verdict`, `statistics`,
  `statistics.transparent`). Targeted exports
  (`exports … to <module>`) grant sibling modules the minimum
  internal-package surface they need —
  `internal.engine.emit` to `punit-report`, `internal.reporting`
  to `punit-report` and `punit-sentinel`. `requires static
  org.junit.jupiter.api` keeps JUnit a compile-time-only
  dependency.
- **`punit-report`** declares module `org.javai.punit.report`.
  `provides org.javai.punit.verdict.VerdictSink with
  org.javai.punit.report.VerdictXmlSink` is the JPMS expression of
  the existing `META-INF/services/` ServiceLoader registration.
- **`punit-sentinel`** declares module
  `org.javai.punit.sentinel`. Explicitly omits `requires` for any
  JUnit module — the compiler now enforces the JUnit-free
  invariant as a property of the module declaration, complementing
  `SentinelArchitectureTest`.
- **`punit-junit5`** has been retired as a published artifact —
  see the *Removed* section below.

### Removed (`org.javai:punit-junit5` Maven coordinate)

`org.javai:punit-junit5` was a dependency-bundler with no
production code. The framework's user-facing annotations
(`@ProbabilisticTest`, `@Experiment`) live in `punit-core/api`;
they are meta-annotated with `@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test` (via
`requires static`) and carry no `@ExtendWith`, so a probabilistic
test reaches the framework by calling
`PUnit.testing(useCase).assertPasses()` inside the test body —
nothing in the JUnit lifecycle needs a punit-supplied extension.
The bundler module added nothing beyond a curated `api` group of
JUnit Jupiter + jackson + log4j that consumers can declare
directly, and its sole content was integration tests and test
subjects (now absorbed into `punit-core`'s test source).

**Migration.** Consumers previously declaring:

```kotlin
testImplementation("org.javai:punit-junit5:<version>")
```

replace it with the direct deps the bundler used to pull in. The
minimal set for an author who writes `@ProbabilisticTest` against
`PUnit.testing(...)` and wants verdict XML emission is:

```kotlin
implementation("org.javai:punit-core:<version>")
testImplementation("org.javai:punit-report:<version>")  // XML VerdictSink
testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter")    // JUnit Jupiter
```

Add `jackson-databind` / `jackson-dataformat-csv` only if the
test sources use `@InputSource` for JSON/CSV inputs; add
`log4j-core` (or another SLF4J backend) only if punit's runtime
logging needs to land somewhere.

### Consumer impact

- **Modular consumers** (own `module-info.java`, depend on punit
  via modulepath) — the `exports` clauses are now the
  authoritative public surface. Attempting to import a non-exported
  `internal.*` package fails to compile and at runtime throws
  `IllegalAccessError`. Existing modular consumers may need to
  add `requires org.javai.punit.core` (or
  `org.javai.punit.report` / `org.javai.punit.sentinel`) to their
  own `module-info.java`.
- **Unnamed-module consumers** (no `module-info.java`, classpath
  build) — no source changes required. JPMS export visibility is
  not gated on the classpath path; these consumers continue to see
  every class on punit's JARs and remain guarded by the
  `internal.*` namespace prefix and the ArchUnit rules.

### Build infrastructure

- `punit-core` applies `org.gradlex.extra-java-module-info` 1.13
  to wrap `org.javai:outcome` as an automatic module. Every other
  transitive dependency is already JPMS-aware (real `module-info`
  in jackson / snakeyaml / log4j / JUnit / opentest4j;
  `Automatic-Module-Name` in commons-statistics).

### Changed (public-surface promotion — breaking FQN change)

Authoring-time and verdict-shape types that previously lived under
`internal.*` packages have been promoted to their natural public
locations. The motivating principle: a type that appears in a
public method signature on a public class must itself be in a
public package, so a JPMS-modularised consumer can compile against
the verdict API without reaching into framework internals.

- `org.javai.punit.internal.engine.budget.CostBudgetMonitor.TokenMode`
  (enum) → `org.javai.punit.verdict.TokenMode` (top-level). The
  enum is a verdict-side label naming how token cost was measured
  (NONE / STATIC / DYNAMIC); it is a peer to `ThresholdOrigin` and
  `Verdict`, not a sub-concept of the budget monitor.
- `org.javai.punit.internal.engine.pacing.PacingConfiguration`
  (record) → `org.javai.punit.api.PacingConfiguration` (top-level,
  alongside the existing `Pacing` builder type). The record carries
  authoring-time pacing constraints + computed execution plan; it
  is consumed by the builder API and read off the verdict, both
  user-facing.

### Changed (package layout — internal relocations)

Renderers and adapters that had drifted into public packages have
been relocated to their natural internal homes. No external API
change (all are non-public classes); only their FQNs move.

- `org.javai.punit.verdict.VerdictTextRenderer` →
  `org.javai.punit.internal.reporting.VerdictTextRenderer`
- `org.javai.punit.verdict.VerdictAdapter` →
  `org.javai.punit.internal.runtime.VerdictAdapter`
- `org.javai.punit.verdict.VerdictSinkBus` →
  `org.javai.punit.internal.reporting.VerdictSinkBus`

The `VerdictSink` interface itself stays public at
`org.javai.punit.verdict.VerdictSink`; only the dispatcher moved.

### Migration

Consumers that referenced any of the four promoted types by FQN:

- `org.javai.punit.internal.engine.budget.CostBudgetMonitor.TokenMode`
  → `org.javai.punit.verdict.TokenMode`
- `org.javai.punit.internal.engine.pacing.PacingConfiguration`
  → `org.javai.punit.api.PacingConfiguration`
- The three renderer/adapter relocations affect only consumers that
  were already reaching into the framework's internal-shaped types —
  not a supported pattern, no migration documented.

### Removed (declarative latency surface — breaking)

The orphan `@Latency` annotation (declared `@Target({})`, no
processor) and the never-populated `assertions` /
`dimensionSuccesses` / `dimensionFailures` fields on
`LatencyDimension` are gone. Latency is descriptive in the verdict
record; gating is expressed via the `PercentileLatency` criterion
on the typed builder.

- **Wire format.** `<latency>` always emits zero violations and no
  `<evaluations>` block. Readers tolerate legacy `evaluations`
  attributes but do not surface them.
- **Migration.** Consumers that referenced `org.javai.punit.api.Latency`
  by FQN — none in practice, since the annotation had no valid target
  — replace it with a `PercentileLatency` criterion on the builder.

### Added (conformance coverage)

- **`VerdictXmlConformanceTest`** asserts that the emitted verdict
  XML round-trips against the canonical RP07 fixture.
- **`MultiDimensionVerdictIntegrationTest`** exercises the
  multi-dimension verdict path end-to-end.
- **`LatencyConformanceTest`** extended with bootstrap-comparison
  cases against the javai-R oracle.

> **🧪 Experimental release.** The 0.7.x structural-cleanup arc:
> dead-code excision, package-drift resolution, the

> changes.

### Removed (breaking)

- **The `org.javai.punit.contract.*` parallel stack is gone.**
  The package was a stillborn second authoring surface (14
  production classes, 13 test classes) that had been deprecated
  but never excised. Replaced where authors actually used it by
  the new `org.javai.punit.api.match` subpackage carrying
  `ValueMatcher`, `MatchResult`, `StringMatcher`, `JsonMatcher`.
  If you were reaching into `contract.*`, the typed authoring
  surface (`Sampling.matching(...)`, `UseCase.postconditions(...)`)
  is the supported path; `api.match` covers the value-matcher
  use case directly.

### Changed (package layout — breaking FQN change)

- The public/internal split is now structural. Every framework-internal
  package moved under `org.javai.punit.internal.*`:
  - `org.javai.punit.engine.*` → `org.javai.punit.internal.engine.*`
    (criteria, baseline, explore, optimize, covariate, spec, budget,
    pacing, emit, …).
  - `org.javai.punit.reporting` → `org.javai.punit.internal.reporting`.
  - `org.javai.punit.util` → `org.javai.punit.internal.util`.
  - The non-`PUnit` residents of `runtime/` (the emitters
    `BaselineEmitter`, `ExploreEmitter`, `OptimizeEmitter`; the
    resolvers `BaselineProviderResolver`, `TestIdentityResolver`; the
    composer `EmpiricalTestComposer`) moved to
    `org.javai.punit.internal.runtime.*`. `PUnit` itself stays public
    at `org.javai.punit.runtime.PUnit`.
- The public packages — `api`, `api.spec`, `api.covariate`, `api.match`,
  `runtime` (for `PUnit`), `verdict`, `statistics`,
  `statistics.transparent` — keep their FQNs.
- Migration for code that imported any of the moved packages: prepend
  `internal.` to the package path. The migration is mechanical and a
  find-and-replace pattern resolves every affected import:
  - `org.javai.punit.engine` → `org.javai.punit.internal.engine`
  - `org.javai.punit.reporting` → `org.javai.punit.internal.reporting`
  - `org.javai.punit.util` → `org.javai.punit.internal.util`

### Changed (verdict XML wire format — breaking)

- `<statistics>` now carries `wilson-lower` (the one-sided Wilson
  lower bound at the verdict's `confidence-level`). The legacy
  `ci-lower` / `ci-upper` attribute pair has been retired.
  Consumers reading verdict XML must update their parsers; the
  reader rejects documents missing `wilson-lower` with a clear
  diagnostic.
- `ProbabilisticTestVerdict.StatisticalAnalysis.ciLower` /
  `ciUpper` record components renamed to `wilsonLower` (single
  one-sided lower bound). The two-sided
  `BinomialProportionEstimator.estimate(...)` is unchanged and
  still validated against the javai-R `wilson_ci` fixture; only
  the verdict path moves to one-sided.
- Verdict text rendering replaces the "CI lower bound:" label with
  "Wilson lower bound:" and drops the prose framing the value as a
  confidence interval.
- The local `verdict-1.0.xsd` is now diff-clean against the
  canonical RP07 verdict-XML schema.

### Changed (package drift — breaking FQN change)

A coordinated sweep ahead of the internal-namespace move resolved
every long-standing package-drift case. Six steps, mostly mechanical
relocations; consumers that imported any of these specific FQNs need
to update.

- `org.javai.punit.power.PowerAnalysis` folded into
  `org.javai.punit.engine.baseline` (then relocated to
  `internal.engine.baseline` under the namespace move). The class is
  a baseline-resolution bridge; co-locating with its primary
  collaborators removed an awkward single-class package.
- The `org.javai.punit.model.*` catch-all is dispersed:
  - `CovariateProfile` consolidated on the typed
    `api.covariate.CovariateProfile` (the duplicate is gone).
  - Covariate-shaped types moved to `api.covariate.*`.
  - `UseCaseAttributes` moved to `api.*`.
  - Verdict-lifecycle types moved to `verdict.*`.
  - The `model/` directory is deleted.
- `org.javai.punit.controls.budget/pacing` collapsed into
  `org.javai.punit.engine.budget/pacing` (then under
  `internal.engine.*`); `controls/` is deleted.
- The top-level `org.javai.punit.spec.{registry,expiration,model,criteria}`
  runtime tree relocated under `engine.spec.*` (then under
  `internal.engine.spec.*`); `api.spec.*` is the public typed-spec
  surface and is unchanged.
- `org.javai.punit.engine.output` folded into
  `org.javai.punit.engine.emit` (then under
  `internal.engine.emit`); `engine/output/` is deleted.

### Added

- `org.javai.punit.api.match` subpackage with `ValueMatcher`,
  `MatchResult`, `StringMatcher`, `JsonMatcher`. Wired through
  `Sampling.matching(...)` for instance conformance.
- `PackageStructureArchitectureTest` carrying the cleanup-arc rules
  with `FreezingArchRule` violation stores under `archunit_store/`.
  Each rule's frozen exception list shrinks as cleanup commits land;
  the rules become permanent regression guards when the stores
  reach empty.
- `RuntimeArchitectureTest.internalRuntimeMustNotImportJUnit` —
  parallel JUnit-free rule for `internal.runtime`.

### Internal

- ArchUnit rule refresh: `CoreArchitectureTest.statisticsModuleMustBeIsolated`
  and `utilPackageMustBeSelfContained` updated to the post-namespace
  layout. `corePackagesMustNotDependOnJUnitExtensions` renamed to
  `statisticsPackageMustNotDependOnJUnitExtensions` (the rule body
  always covered only the statistics package; the old name was stale).
- Six static methods promoted from package-private to `public` to
  cross the new package boundary out of `runtime/` into
  `internal.runtime/`: `BaselineEmitter.emit`,
  `BaselineProviderResolver.resolveDir`/`resolve`,
  `EmpiricalTestComposer.compose`, `TestIdentityResolver.resolve`,
  the `*Emitter.emit` methods. All inside `internal.*` and so still
  off-limits to authors via `publicMustNotImportInternal`.

### Known follow-up

- The `publicMustNotImportInternal` ArchUnit rule's frozen store is
  not empty at release time (116 entries across three categories):
  `runtime.PUnit` driving internals by design; `verdict/*` types
  embedding `internal.engine.budget` / `internal.engine.pacing`
  configuration state for serialisation (package drift, candidate
  for follow-up); `api.covariate.CovariateDeclaration` reaching into
  `internal.util.HashUtils` (small util reach). The rule is a live
  regression guard via `freeze()`; the residue tracks the remaining
  cross-boundary cleanup. Resolving the verdict-embedding drift is
  the prerequisite for adopting JPMS modularisation.

## [0.7.0-alpha2] - 2026-05-10

> **🧪 Experimental release.** Patch over 0.7.0-alpha. Closes the
> wider feasibility-gate audit listed as a "Known gap" in the
> 0.7.0-alpha entry; corrects the empirical-threshold-derivation
> methodology against the javai-R oracle; tightens cost / UX on
> empirical runs that have no resolvable baseline; and removes
> internal tracking codes from public source. No breaking API
> changes vs 0.7.0-alpha.

### Fixed
- **Empirical threshold derivation now applies Wilson at the test
  sample size**, per Statistical Companion §3.4 / §4.3.2. The 0.7.0-alpha
  path applied Wilson at the baseline sample size and compared the
  test's Wilson lower bound against that; this could yield a
  threshold that the test's own confidence machinery couldn't
  underwrite. The fix matches javai-R's reference implementation;
  the conformance fixtures pass tolerance 1e-6.
- **PowerAnalysis.sampleSize now resolves covariate-stamped
  baselines.** A use case declaring covariates could not use the
  confidence-first authoring pattern — `PowerAnalysis.sampleSize`
  threw `IllegalStateException("no baseline found …")` even when a
  matching covariate-stamped baseline existed and was findable by
  the test pipeline's own resolver. Fixed by threading the use
  case's covariate profile + declarations through to the four-arg
  `BaselineResolver` overload.
- **PowerAnalysis admits perfect baselines.** A two-sided
  precondition rejected baselines whose recorded `observedPassRate`
  sat within `mde` of 1.0 — including the common case of a
  `rate = 1.0` baseline. Relaxed to one-sided so the threshold
  path's existing perfect-baseline two-step is reachable from the
  power path too.
- **INCONCLUSIVE verdicts emit a `[PUNIT-INCONCLUSIVE]` line to
  stderr** before the `TestAbortedException` is thrown. Earlier the
  IDE per-test detail pane showed the explanation but the build
  console saw only the four ⊘ icons; a developer watching the build
  log had no account of why a test was skipped.
- **Empirical runs with no resolvable baseline short-circuit
  pre-flight.** Earlier the framework drove the spec through the
  engine — taking *all configured samples* — before the criterion's
  `evaluate` returned INCONCLUSIVE. Each sample is an LLM API call
  in the typical use case; the framework now skips sampling when the
  verdict is structurally guaranteed to be INCONCLUSIVE-no-baseline.

### Added — feasibility-gate audit closes
- **Pre-flight feasibility now applies to contractual criteria too.**
  0.7.0-alpha's `Feasibility.check` silently early-returned for any
  criterion where `!isEmpirical()`; a contractual test with a 99.99%
  SLA at n=50 produced a verdict instead of aborting. Both
  contractual and empirical paths now go through the same gate.
- **Soundness floor enforced regardless of intent.** A configured
  confidence below `StatisticalDefaults.SOUNDNESS_FLOOR_CONFIDENCE`
  (= 0.80) aborts pre-flight in both VERIFICATION and SMOKE intents.
  This was listed as a known gap in 0.7.0-alpha; closes the wider
  feasibility-gate audit.
- **End-to-end audit tests** in `punit-junit5` cover each pre-flight
  invariant via TestKit, with abort-before-sampling verified by a
  counter probe on the use case. The original regression slipped
  past existing unit tests because the gate was wired only at the
  evaluator level — these guard against the same shape of regression
  recurring.

### Changed
- **Orchestrator-internal requirement codes** (the project family's
  internal feature-tracking shorthand) removed from public source —
  javadoc, inline comments, `@DisplayName` strings, assertion
  messages. These tracking codes are interpretable only via an
  internal catalog and were noise to an open-source reader. An
  ArchUnit-style regression guard scans both production and test
  source to keep them out.

### Known gaps still in this experimental release
- **Statistical early termination** (early termination on
  failure-inevitable / success-guaranteed) is still not wired. The
  supporting model is in place but the per-sample evaluator and the
  builder method that opts out have not yet been re-added. Tracked
  for restoration in a subsequent release.

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-05-07

> **🧪 Experimental release.** The first cut of the 0.7.0 typed-builder API. Core authoring surface and statistical engine are ready for evaluation; some optimisations are deferred — see **Known gaps** below. v0.x means breaking changes are still possible: pin to this exact version if you depend on its surface today, and check the issue tracker before upgrading. Feedback at https://github.com/javai-org/punit/issues.

> **⚠️ Breaking changes** — punit 0.7.0 replaces the annotation-driven authoring style of 0.6.x with a typed, builder-based one. See [MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md](docs/MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md) — it carries a coding-assistant prompt that walks your codebase and applies the migration, plus per-change discussion and FAQ. There is no deprecation cycle and no 0.6.x-compatible shim. Maven coordinates are unchanged.

### Changed (breaking)
- **Annotation attributes move to a typed builder.** Configuration that used to live on `@ProbabilisticTest(...)`, `@MeasureExperiment(...)`, `@ExploreExperiment(...)`, `@OptimizeExperiment(...)` is now expressed via builder calls on `PUnit.testing(...)` / `.measuring(...)` / `.exploring(...)` / `.optimizing(...)` invoked from the method body. The annotations survive as bare markers with no attributes. See [MIGRATION §2.1](docs/MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md#21-parameterised-annotation--unparameterised-annotation--builder).
- **Three experiment annotations consolidated to one.** `@MeasureExperiment`, `@ExploreExperiment`, `@OptimizeExperiment` → single `@Experiment` marker; experiment kind is selected by the body's `PUnit.*` factory call. See [MIGRATION §2.1](docs/MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md#21-parameterised-annotation--unparameterised-annotation--builder).
- **`@UseCase` annotation replaced by the typed `UseCase<FT, I, O>` interface.** A use case is now a class implementing the interface; metadata (`description`, `warmup`, `pacing`, `covariates`, …) becomes method overrides; factor variation is expressed via a factor record passed at construction. See [MIGRATION §2.2](docs/MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md#22-use-cases).
- **Covariate redesign.** `@Covariate`, `@CovariateSource`, `@DayGroup`, `@RegionGroup` annotations are gone. Covariates are now values from the sealed hierarchy under `org.javai.punit.api.covariate` (`DayOfWeekCovariate`, `RegionCovariate`, `TimeOfDayCovariate`, `TimezoneCovariate`, `Covariate.custom(...)`), declared on `UseCase.covariates()` and resolved on `UseCase.customCovariateResolvers()` for project-defined covariates. See [MIGRATION §2.3](docs/MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md#23-covariates).
- **`org.javai.punit.contract` package gone.** `Postcondition`, `PostconditionCheck`, `PostconditionEvaluator`, `PostconditionResult`, `UseCaseOutcome` relocated to `org.javai.punit.api`; `ServiceContract` replaced by the typed `Contract<I, O>`, typically folded into the `UseCase` rather than kept as a separate type. See [MIGRATION §2.4](docs/MIGRATION-0.6-to-0.7.md#24-imports-moved-from-contract-to-api).
- **MEASURE baseline shape — aggregate signal only.** Baseline YAML no longer carries the per-sample `resultProjection:` block. The probabilistic test consumes only pass count, sample total, footprint, fingerprint, derived threshold, and the per-clause failure histogram; the per-sample shape is now carried by EXPLORE / OPTIMIZE outputs only. Baselines produced by 0.6.x are not consumed by 0.7.x — regenerate. File size becomes constant in sample count; the EX10 integrity fingerprint covers only content the resolver reads.
- **Failed contract evaluations emit to `System.err` during MEASURE and probabilistic-test runs.** One `[PUNIT-FAIL]` line per failed clause, written synchronously as the engine processes each sample. The line carries the sample index, the failure kind (`apply` / `match` / `postcondition` / `defect`), the clause name, and a single-line reason. Apply-level failures, match mismatches, postcondition failures, and defects all use the same line shape and channel. Stderr is not intercepted by the progress bridge, so failure detail and the `[PUNIT-PROGRESS]` counter on stdout coexist without interleaving.

### Removed (breaking)
- **`@Sentinel` annotation.** The `punit-sentinel` module scans typed `UseCase` implementations directly; no marker required.
- **`@FactorSetter`, `@FactorGetter`, `@FactorAnnotations`.** Reflection-based factor accessors retire entirely. Factors are typed records consumed at construction. (Deprecated in 0.6.0.)
- **`UseCaseProvider.registerAutoWired(...)`** and `UseCaseFactory.registerAutoWired(...)`. Use `registerWithFactors(...)`. (Deprecated in 0.6.0.)
- **Parameter-level annotations no longer wired by the framework**: `@Factor`, `@FactorSource`, `@Input`, `@InputSource`, `@Config`, `@ConfigSource`, `@ControlFactor`, `@DayGroup`, `@RegionGroup`, `@Latency`, `@ExperimentDesign`, `@ExperimentGoal`. Their `@interface` definitions linger in `api/` for binary compatibility, but the engine reads none of them. Use the typed authoring surface.
- **Types removed from `api/`**: `AdaptiveFactor`, `UseCaseContext`, `ProbabilisticTestBudget`. Subsumed by the typed pipeline (custom `FactorsStepper` for adaptive factors; covariate metadata + `TokenTracker` for context; builder-level budget calls + `BudgetExhaustionPolicy` for budget).
- **`OptimizeExperiment.initialControlFactorValue`** (inline string attribute, could not express typed initial values).
- **`OptimizeExperiment.initialControlFactorSource`** (renamed to **`initialFactor`** with identical semantics — a static no-arg method on the experiment class returning the typed initial value).
- **`@FactorGetter` fallback path** in `OptimizeStrategy`. Initial factor values come solely from the `initialFactor` method.
- **`ExploreExperiment.expiresInDays`**. Baseline expiration is a property of MEASURE-produced baseline specs only.

### Added
- **Typed-builder entry points** in `org.javai.punit.runtime.PUnit`: `testing(...)`, `measuring(...)`, `exploring(...)`, `optimizing(...)`.
- **Typed pipeline types in `org.javai.punit.api`**: `Contract<I, O>`, `ContractBuilder<O>`, `Sampling`, `MatchResult`, `ValueMatcher`, `Expectation`, `InputSupplier`, `FactorBundle`, `FactorValue`, `LatencyResult`, `LatencySpec`, plus value records (`BooleanValue`, `DecimalValue`, `DurationValue`, `EnumValue`, `InstantValue`, `IntegralValue`, `StringValue`, `UriValue`).
- **`org.javai.punit.api.spec` subpackage** with spec / verdict / runtime-result types: `Spec`, `TypedSpec`, `Verdict`, `EngineResult`, `EngineRunSummary`, `ProbabilisticTestResult`, `Trial`, `SampleClassification`, `SampleSummary`, `SampleObserver`, `SampleExecutor`, `FactorsStepper`, `NextFactor` (sealed `Continue` / `Stop`), `Scorer`, `ResourceControls` / `ResourceControlsBuilder`, `Criterion`, `EvaluatedCriterion`, `BaselineProvider`, `BudgetExhaustionPolicy`, `FailureCount`, `FailureExemplar`, `LatencyStatistics`, `PassRateStatistics`, `NoStatistics`, `PercentileLatency`, `PercentileKey`, `TerminationReason`, `DurationViolation`, `ExperimentResult`.
- **`org.javai.punit.api.covariate` subpackage** with the sealed `Covariate` hierarchy.
- **`OptimizeBuilder.disableEarlyTermination()`** — opts a single optimize run out of statistical early termination.
- **Postcondition failure histograms** on `SampleSummary`, `ProbabilisticTestResult`, verdict text, verdict XML (`<postcondition-failures>`), and the HTML report. Failures broken down by named clause with bounded exemplars.
- **`EngineRunSummary` on `ProbabilisticTestResult`** — run-level scalars (planned/executed samples, elapsed, tokens, latency, termination, confidence, matched baseline filename).
- **Covariate-aware best-match baseline selection.** Baseline filenames carry a covariate hash; the resolver picks the best-aligned baseline.
- **Pre-flight feasibility gate.** A VERIFICATION-intent test whose configured (samples, threshold, confidence) tuple cannot underwrite a verification claim aborts pre-flight with an `INFEASIBLE VERIFICATION` diagnostic — no samples execute, no misleading PASS / FAIL is produced. Applies to both contractual (`SLA` / `SLO` / `POLICY`) and empirical thresholds. SMOKE-intent runs are silent: the developer has explicitly opted into the sizing gap.
- **RP07 XML verdict on every test.** Each `@ProbabilisticTest` produces a `{className}.{methodName}.xml` file under `build/reports/punit/xml/` (configurable via `punit.report.dir` / `PUNIT_REPORT_DIR`, suppressible with `punit.report.enabled=false`). The HTML report (`./gradlew punitReport`) consumes these files. See Part 11 of the user guide for the field reference.
- **`BaselineLookup.sourceFile`.** Matched baseline filename threaded from `BaselineResolver` through `Spec.conclude` to the verdict XML's `<provenance spec-filename>` attribute.

### Known gaps in this experimental release

These are the rough edges that justify the `-alpha` qualifier. Each is tracked for restoration in a subsequent release.

- **Statistical early termination is not yet wired.** The 0.6.x sample loop stopped early when the outcome became impossible (failure inevitable) or guaranteed (success guaranteed); the spec-engine refactor preserved the supporting model (the `TerminationReason` enum, scenario fixtures, rendering paths) but the per-sample evaluator and the `disableEarlyTermination()` builder method on the probabilistic-test surface have not yet been re-added. Verdicts are correct — every test runs to its configured sample count and produces the right answer — but configurations that could have terminated after a few samples now run all of them.
- **Wider feasibility-gate audit.** The pre-flight gate (see *Added* above) is wired correctly for the failure shape that motivated this release, but the catalog defines a family of related invariants — soundness floor (implied confidence < 80%, cross-intent), parameter-bounds validation, configuration-coherence checks across the threshold-first / sample-size-first / confidence-first approaches. Some of these remain unchecked. Configurations whose implied confidence falls below 80% are not yet rejected across all intents.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Annotations consolidation (breaking).** All user-facing PUnit annotations — `@ProbabilisticTest`, `@MeasureExperiment`, `@ExploreExperiment`, `@OptimizeExperiment` — now live in `punit-core`. Previously, the three experiment annotations lived in `punit-junit5` because they carried `@ExtendWith(ExperimentExtension.class)`; this meta-annotation is now removed. JUnit wiring is handled entirely via ServiceLoader auto-registration (already in place). Users of the `org.javai.punit` Gradle plugin see no change. Maven users and plain-Gradle users without the plugin must set `junit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled=true` in `junit-platform.properties` — see `docs/MAVEN-CONFIGURATION.md`. The fully-qualified annotation names (`org.javai.punit.api.MeasureExperiment` etc.) are unchanged; only the publishing module differs. Sentinel specs in modules that depend on `punit-core` (and not `punit-junit5`) now compile without the reflection-based workaround that shipped in 0.5.x.
- **Immutable use case pattern.** `@FactorSetter`, `@FactorGetter`, and `UseCaseProvider.registerAutoWired` are deprecated and scheduled for removal. Mutable factor patterns violate the i.i.d. assumption required for valid statistical inference. Use `UseCaseProvider.registerWithFactors` to configure factors at construction time. See the Immutable Use Cases section in the user guide.
- **Statistics rework for contract-linked latency.** Latencies are now formally categorised by whether the associated service contract passed or failed. This addresses a prior weakness where latency statistics could be computed over a population that mixed successful and failed invocations, distorting percentile estimates. The change is of course synchronised with the Javai oracle project [javai-R](https://github.com/javai-org/javai-R).
- **Experiment output locations split by semantics.** MEASURE specs (inputs to subsequent `@ProbabilisticTest` runs) still default to `src/test/resources/punit/specs/` and are intended to be committed. EXPLORE and OPTIMIZE outputs (human-review artefacts only) now default to `build/punit/explorations/` and `build/punit/optimizations/` respectively. Downstream projects that were relying on the old default locations for EXPLORE/OPTIMIZE outputs must set `punit.explorations.outputDir` / `punit.optimizations.outputDir` explicitly to restore the prior behaviour. See the Experiment Output Directories section in the user guide.

### Added
- `@ConfigSource` and `@InputSource` can now be combined on the same EXPLORE experiment method, enabling exploration across both configuration and input axes simultaneously.
- Additional validation for `@Input` annotation targets, catching misconfiguration at setup time rather than during sample execution.
- Conformance test coverage extended to match the javai-R statistical oracle for additional edge cases.

### Removed
- **`zjsonpatch` dependency.** PUnit no longer depends on `zjsonpatch`. Downstream consumers that relied on the transitive presence of this library must declare it directly.

### Deprecated
- `@FactorSetter`, `@FactorGetter`, `UseCaseProvider.registerAutoWired` — see **Changed** above.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Latency distribution always visible** — the HTML report now shows p50, p95, and p99 latency values for every test with successful samples, even when no `@Latency` thresholds are configured. Previously, tests without explicit latency thresholds showed dashes in these columns.
- **Per-cell latency colour coding** — latency cells in the HTML report are colour-coded per percentile: green when an asserted threshold is met, red when exceeded, and muted grey when no threshold is configured (observational only).
- **`punitVerify` Gradle task** — a post-execution verification task (wired into `check`) that reads verdict XMLs and fails the build only when a probabilistic test's statistical verdict is FAIL. Individual sample failures during test execution no longer break the build; they are reported as JUnit "aborted" (skipped) rather than "failed", deferring the pass/fail decision to the aggregate verdict.

### Changed
- Framework console output now routes to stdout/stderr instead of Log4j, ensuring visibility in all build environments without Log4j configuration.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Improved accuracy of baseline threshold derivation for high-reliability use cases. The confidence interval used to compute `minPassRate` in MEASURE experiment specs now uses the Wilson score method consistently, matching the statistical engine used elsewhere in PUnit. Previously generated specs with very high observed pass rates (near 100%) may produce slightly different `minPassRate` values when re-measured. Re-running affected MEASURE experiments is recommended.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **HTML test report** — standalone HTML report summarising all probabilistic test verdicts from a test run. Generated via `./gradlew punitReport` from XML verdict files produced during test execution. The report groups results by use case, provides expandable per-test detail (verdict summary, statistical analysis, baseline provenance), latency percentiles, and operator guidance for inconclusive verdicts caused by covariate misalignment.
- Statistical assumptions and limitations disclosure in the HTML report header (collapsed by default)
- `punit-report` module containing XML verdict serialisation, HTML report generation, and report configuration
- `punitReport` Gradle task registered automatically by the PUnit plugin

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- Bumped `org.javai:outcome` transitive dependency from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 — see [outcome 0.2.0 changelog](https://github.com/javai-org/outcome/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for breaking changes to `Failure` record fields (`exception`, `retryAfter`, `correlationId` now return `Optional`)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **PUnit Sentinel** — a JUnit-free execution engine for running probabilistic tests and experiments in deployed environments (staging, production). The Sentinel runs the same `@ProbabilisticTest` and `@MeasureExperiment` methods defined for development-time testing, producing environment-specific baselines and dispatching verdicts to observability infrastructure.
- `@Sentinel` annotation for marking reliability specification classes consumed by both JUnit and the Sentinel engine
- `SentinelRunner` API for programmatic test and experiment execution with use-case-level filtering
- `SentinelMain` CLI with commands (`test`, `exp`), options (`--list`, `--useCase <id>`, `--verbose`, `--help`), and structured exit codes
- `createSentinel` Gradle task (via the `org.javai.punit` plugin) that builds an executable fat JAR containing all `@Sentinel` classes, their dependencies, and the Sentinel runtime
- `WebhookVerdictSink` for dispatching verdicts as JSON to HTTP endpoints with configurable URL, timeout, and headers
- Environment metadata tagging on verdicts (`PUNIT_ENVIRONMENT`, `PUNIT_INSTANCE_ID`)
- Three-module decomposition: `punit-core` (JUnit-free engine), `punit-junit5` (JUnit 5 extensions), `punit-sentinel` (Sentinel runtime)
- `UseCaseFactory` in `punit-core` for JUnit-free use case registration, independent of `UseCaseProvider`
- `SpecRepository` interface with `LayeredSpecRepository` for environment-local-first spec resolution
- Dimension-scoped assertion API: `UseCaseOutcome.assertContract()`, `assertLatency()`, `assertAll()`
- Per-dimension baselines and spec resolution (functional and latency specs as separate files)
- ArchUnit-enforced module boundaries: `punit-core` and `punit-sentinel` have zero `org.junit` dependencies

### Changed
- Reliability specifications now use the spec-first model: `@Sentinel` classes in production source sets, consumed by both JUnit (via inheritance) and the Sentinel engine (directly)
- Explicit `@Latency` attribute on `@ProbabilisticTest` overrides baseline-derived thresholds without causing a misconfiguration error

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Verdict header contradicting verdict body when using spec-derived thresholds — `BernoulliTrialsConfig` was not synced with `TestConfiguration` after baseline `minPassRate` derivation, causing the verdict summary to use stale values

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Latency assertions via `@Latency` annotation with per-percentile thresholds (p50, p90, p95, p99)
- Automatic latency threshold derivation from baseline specs using confidence-interval upper bounds
- Advisory latency mode (default): breaches warn in output but do not fail the test
- Latency enforcement mode (`-Dpunit.latency.enforce=true`) for CI environments with consistent hardware
- Latency feasibility gate for VERIFICATION intent — rejects undersized sample configurations before execution
- Indicative marker for latency results when sample size is below the statistical minimum
- Latency data captured in MEASURE and EXPLORE experiment specs (percentiles, mean, standard deviation, sample count)
- Latency analysis section in transparent statistics output

### Changed
- Improved EXPLORE experiment output format with diff-anchor lines

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Release lifecycle Gradle tasks (`release`, `tagRelease`)
- Centralised version in `gradle.properties`
- `CHANGELOG.md` with validation gate in the release task
- Test intent system: `VERIFICATION` (evidential) and `SMOKE` (sentinel) modes
- Feasibility gate using Wilson score lower bound for verification tests
- Diff-anchor lines in explore experiment output
- Infeasibility fail-fast for infeasible thresholds

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-15

Initial release of PUnit — a JUnit 5 extension framework for probabilistic
unit testing of non-deterministic systems.

### Added
- `@ProbabilisticTest` annotation with configurable samples, minPassRate, and confidence
- `@MeasureExperiment` and `@ExploreExperiment` for baseline measurement and exploration
- `@OptimizeExperiment` for feedback-driven parameter optimization
- Spec-based workflow: measure baseline, generate YAML spec, derive thresholds statistically
- Early termination (impossibility and success-guaranteed detection)
- Time and token cost budgets (method, class, and suite scopes)
- Covariate-aware baseline selection with environmental, temporal, and operational categories
- Design by Contract support via `ServiceContract` and `UseCaseOutcome`
- `@InputSource` for parameterized test inputs (JSON, CSV)
- Instance conformance checking (JSON schema matching)
- Pacing support to avoid rate limits from LLM/API providers
- Statistical engine with Wilson score confidence intervals and threshold derivation
- Verbose statistical explanation output
- Gradle plugin (`org.javai.punit`) for test/experiment task configuration
